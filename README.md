## üß© Problems Breakdown

### (text) Problem 1: Dijkstra ‚Äì Shortest Path [15 points]
Use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path from node E to all other nodes.  
**Deliverable:** Show intermediate steps and resulting path costs.

### (text) Problem 2: A* Search [20 points]
Apply the A* algorithm to find the shortest path from node E using heuristic values derived from geographical positions.  
**Deliverable:** Show step-by-step execution and final path costs.

### (text) Problem 3: Comparison [5 points]
Compare Dijkstra and A* in terms of iterations needed to reach node H.  
**Deliverable:** Justification/explanation in writing.

### (code) Problem 4: Directed or Undirected [10 points]
Write a Java program that takes an `n x n` adjacency matrix and determines if the graph is directed or undirected.

### (code) Problem 5: Every Path of Length 7 [10 points]
Given a directed weighted graph and two vertices `u` and `w`, print every **simple path** from `u` to `w` that has a **length of exactly 7**.

### (code) Problem 6: Draw a Graph [30 points]
Given an array of (vertex, offset) pairs, draw a circular graph where each vertex connects to the vertex `x` positions to its left and right (modular).  
Use **GraphStream (Java)** or any language/library of your choice.  
Partial Credit: A textual adjacency matrix earns 20 points.  
Extra Credit (+5): Implement this in **Java** with GraphStream.

### (text) Problem 7: Algorithm Analysis [10 points]
Provide time and space complexity using **Big-O notation** for the algorithms you implemented in Problems 4‚Äì6.  
**Deliverable:** Written analysis in PDF.

## üìÅ Deliverables

- ‚úÖ GitHub repository with IntelliJ IDEA project files ‚Äì only link, **no zipped projects**
- ‚úÖ A PDF file (`GraphAssignment.pdf`) containing answers to text problems (1, 2, 3, and 7)
- ‚úÖ Code files for Problems 4‚Äì6 in `/src/` folder of the repo
